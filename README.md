# node-tensorflow-serving-demo

Example app combining Express and TensorFlow Serving. Work in progress.

### Getting Started

More details soon, but for now:

1. Set up a TensorFlow Serving instance.
2. Run the [basic tutorial with the MNIST inference server](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/serving_basic).
3. Point this Node app to your TensorFlow Serving host in `config/index.js` in `TENSORFLOW_SERVING_HOST`.
